I bring hands-on experience with industry-leading orchestration tools such as Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Automic, leveraging them to schedule, monitor, and manage complex hourly and daily workflows. I specialize in orchestrating parallel execution with fine-grained control over task-level dependencies, ensuring seamless coordination across upstream and downstream components to guarantee accurate and timely data delivery. My approach includes implementing fault-tolerant, SLA-aware pipelines that recover gracefully from failures.In addition, I have designed and deployed highly configurable, metadata-driven data pipelines that support diverse ingestion strategies—including full refresh, delta/incremental loads, and historical backfills—tailored to both batch and streaming use cases. This enables reusable, scalable, and maintainable data processing frameworks that align with enterprise-grade data engineering standards.",

I bring advanced expertise in managing and transforming complex, nested, and irregular data structures—particularly deeply nested JSONs—through recursive parsing techniques and schema evolution handling. This enables accurate extraction, normalization, and downstream usability of critical information hidden within semi-structured and unstructured datasets. My approach emphasizes schema inference, validation, and robust error handling to ensure resilience and consistency across diverse ingestion scenarios.",

My extraction processes are designed to run in parallel, leveraging Spark’s distributed computing capabilities to ensure efficient, high-throughput data loading with minimal latency.In the transformation phase, I build and optimize Apache Spark-based ETL pipelines by carefully allocating and tuning compute resources—such as executors, memory overhead, and core allocation—to strike a balance between performance and cost. I also apply advanced Spark tuning techniques to address common performance bottlenecks. This includes customizing shuffle partitions, selecting appropriate join strategies based on data volume and distribution, and mitigating issues related to data skew and wide transformations. By combining technical depth in Spark optimization with a clear understanding of data architecture and pipeline reliability, I ensure that large-scale data workflows are not only performant but also robust, maintainable, and production-ready.",

I proactively detect long-running or stalled jobs and implement targeted optimizations—including resource reallocation, configuration tuning, and code refactoring—to restore performance and ensure compliance with strict SLA timelines. In addition to reactive support, I build robust automation using shell scripting and Python to eliminate manual intervention for recurring operational tasks. These scripts handle everything from log parsing and job status reporting to alerting and recovery routines, significantly improving system reliability and reducing incident resolution time. This end-to-end approach ensures that data pipelines remain stable, efficient, and production-ready at all times.",

                content: "Experienced in working across both AWS and Azure cloud ecosystems, with hands-on expertise in a broad range of services. On AWS, I’ve worked with core components such as S3 for storage, EC2 for compute, Lambda for serverless execution, EMR for big data processing, AWS Glue for ETL, Athena for interactive queries, Redshift for data warehousing, and QuickSight for BI and dashboarding. On Azure, my experience includes ADLS Gen2 for scalable data storage, Azure Data Factory for orchestrating complex pipelines, and Azure Databricks for high-performance analytics. I consistently apply cloud best practices—emphasizing cost optimization, scalability, performance tuning, and security compliance—while designing resilient and maintainable data solutions.",

                content: "Utilized Apache Spark functions and Spark SQL to perform complex data cleansing and transformation at scale, ensuring optimal performance and maintainability. For smaller datasets and targeted use cases, employed Python with Pandas to efficiently handle data preparation and preprocessing. Implemented comprehensive data quality frameworks encompassing both technical validations (e.g., null checks, data type enforcement) and business rules (e.g., threshold validations, referential integrity), ensuring trustworthiness and consistency across datasets. Established robust audit logging mechanisms to trace data lineage and identify discrepancies across data pipeline layers, facilitating quick diagnostics and resolution. Additionally, developed automated solutions for schema evolution—including dynamic handling of column additions and deletions—enabling seamless ingestion of evolving source structures without manual intervention.",

I proactively mediate between stakeholders to ensure technical clarity, manage expectations, and maintain a productive and respectful work environment. Mentor junior engineers and interns on best practices in coding, data engineering, and performance optimization, while also guiding them through real-world problem-solving scenarios. I facilitate knowledge sharing, provide actionable feedback, and assign tasks strategically to support both individual growth and team efficiency. Take ownership of upstream and downstream dependency coordination by engaging with internal and external teams, gathering and clarifying requirements, and ensuring seamless integration across systems. Additionally, I help identify and resolve internal conflicts or blockers, enabling smooth day-to-day operations and long-term project success.",
